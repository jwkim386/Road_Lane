    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Current pipeline\n",
    "Currently, my pipeline is as follows:\n",
    "* Keep only yellow and white pixels, black out all other pixels: *filter_colors()*\n",
    "  * This removes any unwanted edges from shadows, cracks in the road, etc.\n",
    "* Convert image into grayscale: *grayscale()*\n",
    "* Apply Gaussian smoothing: *gaussian_blur()*\n",
    "* Run Canny Edge Detector: *canny()*\n",
    "* Create a trapezoidal region-of-interest in the center lower-half of the image: *region_of_interest()*\n",
    "* Run Hough Line Detector: *hough_lines()*\n",
    "* Filter Hough lines by slope and endpoint location, and separate them into candidate right/left lane line segments. Then run linear regression on candidate right/left lane line segment endpoints, to create right/left lane line equations. From these equations, draw right/left lane lines on the image: *draw_lines()*\n",
    "\n",
    "I tuned the parameters for the Canny Edge Detector and Hough Line Detector specifically to fit this problem. As a starting point, I used the parameters presented in the quiz solution of the Hough Transform lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential shortcomings\n",
    "The algorithm I created is likely overfitted to the data available in this project. For example, the algorithm may fail during night time. Or, it may fail in bad weather, such as rain or snow. Even during sunny days, if the road curves more sharply, my algorithm may also fail, because I am trying to extrapolate straight lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible improvements\n",
    "To start, I would test my algorithm on highway roads, but with different weather conditions, such as night time, rain, snow, etc. I would also test my algorithm when there is heavy traffic on the highway. Then, I would see how/if the algorithm fails in those situations. From there, I can figure out ways to improve the algorithm to make it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, I would test my algorithm on different road types, i.e. roads that are not highways. Examples would be country roads or urban roads."
